Sahana is a Free and Open Source Disaster Management system.
It is a web based collaboration tool that addresses the common coordination problems during a disaster from finding missing people, managing aid, managing volunteers, tracking camps effectively between Government groups, the civil society (NGOs) and the victims themselves.

SahanaPy is a ground-up rewrite of Sahana to retain all the great functionality & usability whilst ensuring a solid foundation for future enhancements by a diverse community of development groups.
